  elevatorPitch:
    "Dudester is a founder guild from RTP turning decades of Web1/Web2 scar tissue into Web3/AI advantage. We vibecode—using intuition, taste, and copilots—to ship small, useful software that compounds into products and, eventually, companies.",
  positioningStatement:
    "For builders who value velocity and taste, Dudester is a founder-led product studio that combines senior operator judgment with modern AI/Blockchain execution—delivering opinionated tools that feel human and ship fast.",
  originStory: [
    "We lived through dial-up modems, Perl CGI, and copy-pasting table layouts. We scaled during cloud booms and mobile revolutions. The pattern we trust most: waves reward the ones who ship small, align with reality, and iterate without ego.",
    "Now the AI/Blockchain wave unlocks agents, automation, and trust-minimized rails. Dudester exists to surf that wave together—four seasoned founders merging perspective into one product at a time."
  ],
  principles: [
    "Ship > Shout — momentum over mythology.",
    "Taste is a feature — UX is market insight rendered.",
    "Compound learning — tiny launches, tight loops.",
    "Pragmatic AI — use copilots to accelerate, not anesthetize thinking.",
    "Trust rails — cryptographic guarantees where they matter.",
    "Ageless edge — experience is compound interest."
  ],
  toneOfVoice: [
    "Playful/sassy but respectful.",
    "Strategic and forward-leaning.",
    "Minimalist, confident, no fluff.",
    "Poetic when it deepens meaning, never purple."
