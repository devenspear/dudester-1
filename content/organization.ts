  structure:
    "Dudester LLC operates as a founder collective and product studio. We incubate micro-apps and utilities (Dudester Drops). When a Drop earns traction, we graduate it into a product pod with its own P&L.",
  governance:
    "Majority decisions for day-to-day; rotating chair for tie-breaks. Product pods have a directly responsible individual (DRI). Decisions live in the repo via Issues/PRsâ€”documented, reviewable, searchable.",
  cadence:
    "Monthly Dudester Drop demo. Quarterly roadmap review with scorecards. Annual Summit & Hackathon to converge on a bigger bet.",
  ip:
    "Code is owned by Dudester LLC. Founders assign relevant IP upon contribution. External collaborators sign NDAs and Contributor License Agreements.",
  revenue:
    "Two modes: (1) Pooled studio revenue with founder splits, (2) Product-specific equity for spin-outs. Mode chosen at pod inception.",
  privacy:
    "Privacy-first by default. Collect the minimum. Encrypt where sensible. Prefer verifiable trust over permission sprawl."
